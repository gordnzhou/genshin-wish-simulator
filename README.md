# Genshin Wish Simulator

This is an app that simulates the 
[Gacha system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game) called *Wishing*, 
from the game [Genshin Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact).
Users will be able to *Wish* for their desired characters or weapons, 
explore various outcomes, and track their progress. 

This application is designed for Genshin Impact players 
and enthusiasts who want to experience the excitement of the 
game's wishing system without any risk. As a fan of the game, I've always found the wishing system a very intriguing part
of the gameplay experience. The excitement and anticipation associated with making 
wishes contribute significantly to the game's appeal and this app will help
bring that excitement to a broader audience.
